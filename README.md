# Breast Cancer Classification ML Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for the classification of breast cancer tumors. The model is trained to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original), which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features

The model uses a set of features such as radius, texture, smoothness, and more, extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and the confusion matrix. Refer to the notebook for a detailed analysis of the results.
